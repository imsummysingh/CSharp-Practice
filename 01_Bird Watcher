**Instructions**
You're an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden in the last seven days.
You have six tasks, all dealing with the numbers of birds that visited your garden.

Task 1
Check what the counts were last week
For comparison purposes, you always keep a copy of last week's counts nearby, which were: 0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8 and 4. Implement the (static) BirdCount.LastWeek() method that returns last week's counts:
BirdCount.LastWeek();
// => [0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8, 4]

Task 2
Check how many birds visited today
Implement the BirdCount.Today() method to return how many birds visited your garden today. The bird counts are ordered by day, with the first element being the count of the oldest day, and the last element being today's count.
int[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };
var birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);
birdCount.Today();
// => 1

Task 3
Increment today's count
Implement the BirdCount.IncrementTodaysCount() method to increment today's count:
int[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };
var birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);
birdCount.IncrementTodaysCount();
birdCount.Today();
// => 2

Task 4
Check if there was a day with no visiting birds
Implement the BirdCount.HasDayWithoutBirds() method that returns true if there was a day at which zero birds visited the garden; otherwise, return false:
int[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };
var birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);
birdCount.HasDayWithoutBirds();
// => true

Task 5
Calculate the number of visiting birds for the first number of days
Implement the BirdCount.CountForFirstDays() method that returns the number of birds that have visited your garden from the start of the week, but limit the count to the specified number of days from the start of the week.
int[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };
var birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);
birdCount.CountForFirstDays(4);
// => 14

Task 6
Calculate the number of busy days
Some days are busier that others. A busy day is one where five or more birds have visited your garden. Implement the BirdCount.BusyDays() method to return the number of busy days:
int[] birdsPerDay = { 2, 5, 0, 7, 4, 1 };
var birdCount = new BirdCount(birdsPerDay);
birdCount.BusyDays();
// => 2







**Code Solution:**

using System;

class BirdCount
{
    private int[] birdsPerDay = {2,5,0,7,4,1};
    static int[] birdsLastWeek = new int[]{0,2,5,3,7,8,4};
    
    public BirdCount(int[] birdsPerDay)
    {
        this.birdsPerDay = birdsPerDay;
    }

    public static int[] LastWeek()
    {
        return birdsLastWeek;
    }

    public int Today()
    {
        int countToday = birdsPerDay.Length-1;
        return birdsPerDay[countToday];
    }

    public void IncrementTodaysCount()
    {
        int countToday = birdsPerDay.Length-1;
        birdsPerDay[countToday]++;        
    }

    public bool HasDayWithoutBirds()
    {
        foreach(int bird in birdsPerDay){
            if (bird==0){
              return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public int CountForFirstDays(int numberOfDays)
    {
        int totalBirds=0;
        for(int i=0;i<birdsPerDay.Length;i++){
            if(i<numberOfDays){
                totalBirds+=birdsPerDay[i];
                continue;
            }
            break;
        }
        return totalBirds;
    }

    public int BusyDays()
    {
        int count=0;
        foreach(var bird in birdsPerDay){
            if(bird>=5){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
